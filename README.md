# Rainsong

A Skyrim mod that extends [Azurite II weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731) and [RAID weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116) to enhance rain sounds with regional variations as well as intensity variations.

The mod itself is contained entirely in the `data/` subfolder. The `plugins/` directory contains the mod's plugins serialized to YAML using [spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit).

These rain loops are synthesized with [a VST plugin](https://www.boomlibrary.com/sound-effects/rain/). (I use both Bitwig Studio and Ableton Live as hosts.) They're all 8 seconds long and stereo. They make a great base for layering on field recordings of thunder, wind, and closer-range rain sounds. The presets I made for the plugin are in the [scenes](./scenes) directory.

See the [nexus mods readme source](./nexus_docs.md) for details about how this mod edits weathers.
